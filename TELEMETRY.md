Joinly's critical reliance on Whisper and Deepgram STT services may  result in total agent failure, the Transcript Drift / STT Failure Spike monitor continuously tracks the joinly.stt.transcription_error_rate metric and triggers a Datadog incident if the error rate exceeds 5% over a two-minute window. Tagged with stt:whisper or stt:deepgram, this alert automatically captures vital diagnostic context—including the last 10 transcript chunks, provider statistics, and drift analysis comparing audio duration to transcription time—to rapidly identify and resolve high-impact issues such as model overload, microphone capture failures, dropped audio frames, or API outages.
